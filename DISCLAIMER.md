# Disclaimer

This repository contains a public MVP demonstrating a Fetch.ai uAgent adapter
designed for research, development, and infrastructure experimentation purposes.

The agents provided here:
- operate in read-only, analysis-only mode
- do not perform transactional, contractual, or legally binding actions
- are intended to demonstrate inspectable agent communication and JSON-based contracts

This repository does not represent a production deployment.
Any use of autonomous agents in live or commercial environments requires
separate evaluation of legal, compliance, and operational considerations.

The grant-funded scope of this work is limited to open-source agent adapters
and does not include production operations or service-level guarantees.
